# CreditCardPaymentCalculator

Modular Design: The code is organized into separate functions, each responsible for a specific task. For example, get_min_payment() calculates the minimum payment required for a credit card balance, interest_charged() computes the interest charged on the balance, and remaining_payments() determines the number of payments required to pay off the credit card balance. This modular design enhances code readability and maintainability by isolating different functionalities.

Command-line Interface: The code utilizes the argparse library to parse command-line arguments. This allows users to input parameters such as the balance amount, annual APR, credit line, and optional payment amount and fees directly from the command line when running the script. By providing a command-line interface, users can easily interact with the script without modifying the source code.

Error Handling: The code includes robust error handling to handle invalid inputs gracefully. For instance, it checks for negative balance amounts, APR values outside the valid range of 0 to 100, non-positive credit lines, and negative payment amounts or fees. If any of these conditions are met, the script raises a ValueError with an appropriate error message, ensuring that the user is informed of the issue and the script exits cleanly.

Informative Output: The main function main() generates informative output detailing the recommended minimum payment, the number of payments required to pay off the balance, and the months spent over certain credit line thresholds (25%, 50%, and 75%). This provides users with valuable insights into their credit card repayment strategy and helps them make informed decisions about their finances.

Flexibility: The script offers flexibility by allowing users to specify custom payment amounts, fees, and credit lines through command-line arguments. Users can tailor the inputs to analyze different scenarios and understand how varying parameters affect their repayment timeline and financial obligations.

Documentation: Each function in the code is thoroughly documented with docstrings. These docstrings provide clear explanations of the function's purpose, arguments, and return values, making it easier for other developers to understand and utilize the code. Good documentation enhances code maintainability and promotes collaboration among team members.
